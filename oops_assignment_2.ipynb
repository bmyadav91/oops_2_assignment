    "Ans:\n",
    "The __del__ method in Python is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted. It serves as a destructor and is often used to perform cleanup operations before the object is removed from memory. The __del__ method is called automatically when an object is no longer referenced, and the garbage collector decides to reclaim its memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the __init__ method is a constructor responsible for initializing an object when it's created, the __del__ method is a destructor that is called just before an object is deleted. The constructor and destructor represent the two ends of an object's lifecycle.\n",

    "Ans: Polymorphism in Python offers several benefits in terms of code reusability and flexibility, making it a powerful feature of object-oriented programming. Here are some key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "Interface Standardization: Polymorphism allows the creation of a common interface through abstract classes or interfaces. Subclasses can implement this interface, ensuring a consistent set of methods. This standardization promotes code reusability as objects of different classes can be treated uniformly through the common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promotes Composition:\n",
    "By designing classes to adhere to a common interface, it becomes easier to compose complex systems by combining objects of different types. This composability enhances code reusability, as existing classes can be reused in various combinations to build new functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Binding: \n",
    "Polymorphism provides dynamic method resolution at runtime. This means that the appropriate method is determined based on the actual type of the object, allowing for flexibility in method invocation. This dynamic binding promotes adaptability and extensibility."

    "Flexibility and Modularity:\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Composition allows for more flexible and modular code design. With composition, classes can be designed to have well-defined responsibilities, and relationships between classes are more explicit.

    "Multiple inheritance in Python can lead to the \"diamond problem,\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This can result in ambiguity in method resolution. Composition avoids this problem entirely, as it does not involve inheriting from multiple classes. Instead, it allows for combining objects without inheriting their interfaces or implementations.y.:"

    "Ans: \n",
    "Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained components. Each component is responsible for a specific functionality or feature. This separation of concerns makes it easier to understand, modify, and maintain individual pieces of the code.\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "With composition, you can create reusable components that encapsulate specific behaviors. These components can be used across different parts of the program or even in other projects, promoting code reusability and reducing redundant code.\n",
    "Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Components created through composition are typically more flexible and extensible. You can easily add or replace components without affecting the entire system. This flexibility makes it simpler to adapt the code to changing requirements or to extend its functionality.\n",
    "Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Components can be tested in isolation, which simplifies the testing process. When issues arise, debugging becomes more straightforward as you can focus on the specific component causing the problem rather than the entire system.\n",
    "Ease of Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a change is needed, you can focus on the relevant component without affecting unrelated parts of the system. This localized approach to modifications reduces the risk of introducing unintended side effects and makes maintenance tasks more manageable.\n",
    "Improved Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition often leads to cleaner and more readable code. Each class or component has a specific purpose, and the relationships between components are explicitly defined. This clarity enhances code readability and makes it easier for developers to understand the overall structure.\n",
    "Reduced Code Duplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows you to reuse existing components in different contexts, reducing the need for duplicating code. This not only saves development time but also ensures consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors introduced by duplicated code.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the program grows, a well-composed codebase is more scalable. New features can be added by creating new components or extending existing ones, and the overall structure remains organized and maintainable."
